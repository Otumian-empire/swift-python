# exercise 3 (More on data types and comments)
There is another data type that is called boolean. This data type can only be True or False. Boolean values are generated when values are compared or when there is a condition. `Eg 1 < 2 is True, 1 > 2 is False`.

## Examples
```
is_online = True
is_swift = False
is_human = True
```

## Note
Boolean values are case sensity. Upper-case `T` for `True` and `F` for `False`.

## Comment
A comment is basically a piece of text that tells why or what you are trying to achieve. The `#` symbol, placed ( inserted) at the beginning of the line, comments the line ( is ignored by the interpreter).

## Examples
```
# Hello world program
# Display Hello world for the user to see
# Useing the print function
print("Hello world")
```

The first 3 lines starting with `# ` are comments and they are ignored during execution. You can also comment out some lines during debugging.

## Note
Whatever that comes after the `#` would be ignored.
`print('hello world') # greetings`, _greetings_ would be ignored.

## Praticals
1. In exercise 2, add comments to your solutions to give the why/what the line is doing or meant to do ( remember that not all lines needs comment if the code is discriptive itself).
1. 
    * How many comments are there in the code below?
    * Which parts ( lines) would be displayed and why? 

```
1 # John Doe - profile
2 print("My name is John Doe") # yes that's my name
3 print("He washes my hair")
4 # i like to dance in the rain print("This costs $25.00")
5 my_name = "Danny Doe Dan"
```

## Summary
* A boolean value is `True` or `False`.
* These values are generated during comparison.
* A comment is supposed to explain, "the" what or why in the code ( line)
* Use `#` to create a comment
