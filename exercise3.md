# Exercise 3 ( More on data types and comments)
There are other data types apart from those mentioned earlier in `Exercise 2 (Data types)` . We shall discuss `boolean` data type.

This data type can only be `True` or `False` . Boolean values are generated when values are compared or when there is a condition. `Eg 1 < 2 is True, 1 > 2 is False` .

## Examples

``` python
is_online = True
is_swift = True
is_human = False
```

### Note

Boolean values are case sensity. Upper-case `T` for `True` and `F` for `False` , in python.

## Comment

A comment is a piece of text that mostly should tells why or what we are trying to achieve. The `#` symbol, placed ( inserted) at the beginning of the line, comments the line ( the line is ignored by the interpreter).

## Examples

``` python
# Hello world program
# Display Hello world for the user to see
# Useing the print function
print("Hello world")
```

The first 3 lines starting with `#` are comments and they are ignored during execution. You can also comment out some lines during debugging.

### Note

Whatever that comes after the `#` would be ignored.
`print('hello world') # greetings` , _greetings_ would be ignored.

## Praticals

1. In `Exercise 2 (Data types)` , add comments to your solutions to give the why/what the line is doing or meant to do ( remember that not all lines needs comment if the code is discriptive itself).

1.  - How many comments are there in the code below?
    - Which parts ( line numbers) would be displayed and why? 

    ``` python 
    1 # John Doe - profile
    2 print("My name is John Doe") # yes that's my name
    3 print("He washes my hair")
    4 # i like to dance in the rain print("This costs $25.00")
    5 my_name = "Danny Doe Dan"
    ```

## Summary

* A boolean value is `True` or `False` .
* These values are generated during comparison.
* A comment is supposed to explain, "the" what or why in the code ( line)
* We can also use it to state how we want to reach our solution
* Use `#` to create a comment
