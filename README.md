# Swift-Python
This is a swift presentation of the basics of programming, using the python programming language to the extent that we can take it.

This is meant for anyone who is interested in learning python given a limitted period or an experienced developer who want to pick up the python programming. Also students who have taken introduction to computer science or programming would find this helpful in their own frame.

The content and examples, is swift, quick and summarized with examples to try out after reading. We intend to make it better by improving upon it as time passes, add more practical examples for practice sake.

The content in here is very simple to follow, all you need is the latest or stable version of python available on your PC and your favourite text editor or simply install an IDE.


You basically read the content, take notes and try the exercises for your own good.
