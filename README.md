This is a swift presentation on the basics of programming, using the python programming language to the extent that we can take it.

This material is meant for anyone interested in learning python given a limited period or an experienced developer who want to pick up the python programming. Also, students who have taken an introduction to computer science or programming would find this helpful in their frame.

The content and examples are simple, quick and summarized with examples to try out after reading. We intend to make it better by improving upon it as time passes, add more practical examples for practice sake.

The content here is very simple to follow, all you need is the latest or stable version of python available on your PC and your favourite text editor or simply install an IDE.

Read the content, take notes and try the exercises/practicals/practice projects for your good.

## What you will learn

- How to install python and an IDE (or text editor)
- Programming concepts such as:
  - Variables and operators
  - Input and output
  - Conditions and loops
  - Exceptions and Exception Handling
  - File Handling
  - OOP and Modules
  - Unit testing
  - Git
  - SQL and SQLite
- How to create/start your project

## To compile to pdf

Visit [markdowntopdf][markdowntopdf], and select the exercise you want to turn to pdf (You want to have [swift-python] locally).

## To contribute

- edit or update a content
- fix typos
- read the content and provide feedback
- translate the content
- share material with others
- assist others in understanding the material
- create an issue

## To implement a project

Not necessary though. One should break the project into basically four phases, i.e:

- Analysis phase
- Design phase
- Implementation phase
- Test phase

> The test phase should be ignored if a test is not needed (Unit testing is another way into the documentation).

> Add comments to make understanding the code better or better write readable code

> You can choose to add all phases in one file

**Know that the file extension should be `.md` for any other file that is not `.py`**
