# Exercise 5 a (Analysis of a problem)
In this part, we would would look into how to create a solution to a given problem. Lets consider a very basic problem to do with.

## Sample problem

``` python 
'''In a test of five students, the marks, 40, 78, 91, 59 and 12 were obtained. If the test score was over 100. Find the

    1. sum of the scores obtained by the student
    2. average of the score
    3. number of students who scored above the average score
    4. number of students who scored below the average score

'''
```

## Analysis

To analyse the sample problem above, there are basically three things you need to know about the problem or you have to look out for. These are:

1. The input
1. The output
1. The process

### The input

This is simply the parameters that are given in the problem, and for the above they are:

1. the total number of students, which is five.
1. the individual scores, which are 40, 78, 91, 59 and 12.
1. the overall score, which is 100.

### The output

This is what the program is expected to do, what the user would see, finally after the process. Usually, we look at the process ( calculations before the out comes but here it is a good practice to know what is desired). We are expected to compute the values for the:

1. sum of the scores
2. average of the scores
3. number of students who scored above the average score
4. number of students who scored below the average score

### Note

Usually the desired output dictates how to compute on the input to obtain the output.

### The process

This is also known as the computation. From the problem, we are to compute the sum of the scores and the others. Our focus here is "the how" the computation is/will done. Most often, there would be a straight forward formular to use, else you have to find it. So now, all you have to think about, is how to compute the :

1. sum of the scores
2. average of the scores
3. number of students who scored above the average score
4. number of students who scored below the average score

### Note

The result from the computation is what becomes our output though not all becomes the output.
