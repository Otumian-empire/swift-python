# Exercise 1 (creating a variable)
A variable is a placeholder ( a name) give to an address ( a memory location) of a value in memory.
You can think of a variable as a box, which has a name. This box will have a value and when ever you reference (call) this variable ( name of the address), you then get the value stored at that address.
To create a variable and assign it a value, all you have to think about is an equation. 
`Eg: x = 2`. x is the variable ( the placeholder) that points to the address of the value, 2. So 2 is the value. A single ( one) equal to sign, `=` is known as the assignment operator. It takes what is on the right ( the value) and assigns it to whats on the left (the variable). It takes the value and puts it in the variable ( box).
In python, the data type of a value is determined or controlled dynamically ( meaning as the program runs) so you don't have to worry about it.

## More examples: 
```
x = 3
name = "Al-matrude"
age = 45
weight = 23.7
grade = "A+"
```
All these are examples of variable assignment ( varaible creation) of different data types.

## Practicals
* Create 10 variables and assign them values of your choice ( perhaps, as above).


## Summary:
* A variable represents the name given to the memory address (location of a value in memory).
* Referencing (calling) the variable returns the value
* The Value stored in a variable can change anytime - thats why we call it a variable
* To create a variable, think about an equation, LHS = RHS. LSH is the variable_name, RHS is the value .`Eg: fullname = "John Doe"`
