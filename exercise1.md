# Exercise 1 ( creating a variable)
A variable is a placeholder ( a name, a container) given to an address ( a memory location) of a value in memory.
You can think of a variable as a box, which has a name. This box will have a value and whenever you reference ( call) this variable ( name of the address), you then get the value stored at that address.
To create a variable and assign it a value, all you have to think about is an equation.
`Eg: x = 2` . `x` is the variable ( the placeholder) that points to the address of the value, `2` . So `2` is the value. A single ( one) equal-to sign, `=` , is known as the assignment operator. It takes what is on the right ( the value) and assigns ( puts) it into what is on the left ( the variable). It takes the value and puts it into the variable.
In Python, the data type of a value is determined or controlled dynamically ( meaning as the program runs) so you don't have to worry about it.

## More examples: 

``` Python
# variable assignment
x = 3
city = "Albuquerque"
age = 45
weight = 23.7
grade = "A+"
```

All these are examples of variable assignment ( varaible creation) of different data types.

## Practicals

* Create 10 variables and assign them values of your choice ( perhaps, as above).

## Summary:

* Variable represents the name given to the memory address.
* Calling the variable returns the value
* The Value stored in a variable can change anytime - thats why we call it a variable
* To create a variable, think about an equation, LHS = RHS. LSH is the variable_name, RHS is the value . `Eg: fullname = "John Doe"`
