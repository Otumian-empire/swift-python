# Exercise 0 ( Set up)
Some believed programming was meant for some particular individuals with some particular skills, which before felt almost true, due the complexity of the tokens used to instruct the computer at the time. Guido van Rossum and the community, made it possible and simpler, through Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, for anyone with the least interest in learning how to instruct a computer to perform some basic task, the opportunity to do so. It is our dream that many would also learn how to code by introducing them to Python from ground zero.

## Aim

After reading this book and doing almost all the exercises and projects, the reader is guaranteed to muster, at the end, the sense and skill in programming using Python and would be able to adapt or translate the concept to other programming languages.

## Who is the book meant for

This book is suited for individuals from any work of like, novice to expert, first timers - noobs to veterans. We trust anyone who gets hold of this book could speak, read and understand English - can hold a conversation in English language as this book is written in English.

## Prerequisite

We expect the reader to be patient, determined, committed, genuine and not necessarily passionate but interested in programming. The reader must have a platform for coding, such as a laptop, desktop, which we recommend greatly, a tablet or a smart phone. Whatever experience the reader may have is a plus.

## Set up environment

The code presented in this book would run on any major operating system. The reader may need, a development environment which we shall use to write and test the codes.

There are basically three ways to set up and either is okay as far as the reader is confident in the environment chosen. We assume the user is using a PC.

### Installing Python

Install Python from the [Python website][Python-site]. Windows user may make reference to this [video][Python-on-windows] for assistance.

#### Unix and Linux users

Unix and Linux user may have Python already installed on their PC. To test whether you have Python installed, open the terminal (command-line) and type, `python` then press enter. For the Linux users, also do for `python3` since we are interested in the features of `python3` . Something like, 

``` 
Python 3.6.9 (default, Nov  7 2019, 10:44:02) 
[GCC 8.3.0] on Linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> |
```

then we are good to go. Just make sure that Python 3.x.x used. This also goes for the Windows users too.

Copy and past, `"Hello there.."` and press enter. What did you see?

### IDE: Pycharm

IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It comprises of a text editor and the interpreter bundled and shipped together. We recommend Pycharm. Download it [here][Pycharm-site].

### IDLE: Python's - windows

Windows users may have access to the default IDLE that comes packaged with Python.

### Text Editor and command-line: vscode

At this option, the user has terminal (command-line, shell, ... ) and a text editor such as notepad, notepad++, sublime, vscode, nano, etc. So user makes use of the editor and interpreter through the terminal. We recommend vscode as it has the terminal inside the text editor so no need to go back and forth. Install vscode from [here][vscode-site].

## Note

It is a little bit hard to navigate through the directories as a noob and if user insists on using the command-line and text editor, we recommend the watch this [video][windwos-cmd-site] for windows user and [video][unix-linux-cmd-site]. There is more also [here][advanced-cmd]. Though Pycharm is OK.

### Structure of the book

This book user exercise instead of chapter. It is majorly divided into five parts.

1. Exercise 1 to 8 covers the fundamentals.
1. Exercise 9 to 13 covers some operators, loops and functions.
1. Exercise 14 to 17 covers some built-in data structures.
1. Exercise 18 to 22 covers some exceptions, file handling, OOP, modules and unit testing.
1. Exercise 23 to 25 covers Git, SQL and SQLite3.

## How to read this book

We recommend the reader reads through each exercise based on the major divisions. Like any other skill, it requires time to horn thus, spend as much time as needed to complete each exercise diligently. It is sometimes recommended to glance through a book before actually reading it. Do that, it may help.

* First timers really do require the fundamentals
* Experienced but new to Python, should skim through the fundamentals

## How to get assistance reading this book

Get assistance reading this book from [Swift Python][swift-Python-site] GitHub page or send us an email at [our email][our-email]. There are other programming platforms on telegram, Facebook or even copy and pasting the error into google or just googling the problem, checking stackoverflow and other coding platforms.

## Feed back

We have worked diligently through this book and a typo or misinterpretation of a concept may be lurking somewhere. Thus readers may send us a feed back through [our email][our-email] or comment on it on [Swift Python][swift-Python-site] GitHub page. Readers may also send a pull request too. Therefore we are opened to suggestions on improved in any form.
